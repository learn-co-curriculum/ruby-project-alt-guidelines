#### **Description**
An estimated 1.1 million New York City residents, including 339,000 children, are food 
insecure. Our app helps them find food pantries and soup kitchens, so they don't have to worry 
about where their next meal will come from.
Users can search for food pantries, banks, and other food resources located in New York City 
which cater to those in need. 

#### **Functionality**
This app allows users to save food resources to their list of favorite resources and give them 
a memorable nickname for quick access later on. You can view your saved resources, edit their 
nicknames, and delete them from your favorite resources list later on. To view a list of 
potential resources in your neighborhood, go to Find Resources and filter by Borough. You can

also view resources by whether or they offer fresh food or nonperishable items or view 
resources by their descriptions.

#### **Project Status**
We would love to eventually provide a larger data pool gathered through the use of an external 
API or through a web scraper. This additional data would allow users to view a more 
comprehensive list of pantries in their area.
