#### **Description**
An estimated 1.1 million New York City residents, including 339,000 children, are food 
insecure. Our app helps them find food pantries and soup kitchens, so they don't have to worry 
about where their next meal will come from.
Users can search for food pantries, banks, and other food resources located in New York City 
which cater to those in need. 

#### **Functionality**
This app allows users to save food resources to their list of favorite resources and give them 
a memorable nickname for quick access later on. You can view your saved resources, edit their 
nicknames, and delete them from your favorite resources list later on. To view a list of 
potential resources in your neighborhood, go to Find Resources and filter by Borough. You can 
also view resources by whether they offer fresh food or nonperishable items or view 
resources by their descriptions.


#### **Set up and run**
- Fork this repository on Github
- Clone in your computer’s terminal
- Open the folder in your text editor if you wish to see the code. Skip otherwise.
- Run `bundle` to install gemfile
- Run `rake start` to start the app


#### **Project Status**
We would love to eventually provide a larger data pool gathered through the use of an external 
API or through a web scraper. This additional data would allow users to view a more 
comprehensive list of pantries in their area.
